# Utils

This is the module that contains all the basic logic to read the json files that come from `qlued`. It also allows for validation etc. So if you are not a developer that tries to extend the core behavior of the `sqooler` it is unlikely that you should modify this part of the code. However, it is instructive to have a look below to understand the  modules that are provided for the creation of a simulator.


Below you can find the API of the `utils`.
