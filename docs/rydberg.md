# Rydberg

This simulates the operation of a Rydberg tweezer array, i.e. a line of qubit that might be entangled through a Rydberg blockade. It can be deployed on qlued as described on their documentation. Below you can find the API of the simulator.

## Config

    handler: python 
    options:
      show_source: true

## Simulation code

::: rydberg.spooler
    handler: python
